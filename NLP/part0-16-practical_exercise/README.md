# practical_exercise 
- Training a deep neural network on MNIST with PyTorch

file name | purpose
---|---|
model.py | Define a model architecture class : Block, ImageClassifier
predict.ipynb | Generate .ipynb file instead of .py file to visualize inference result
train.py | Entry point of trainer.py and utils.py for training purposes
trainer.py | Define a class that receives the model and data and performs the actual training iteration
utils.py | Script file : a bunch of modules commonly used within the solution
model.pth | Best model : optimal weight parameter, lowest generalization error
